## 👋 Hey there!

I’m Hemant — a data-driven thinker with a passion for uncovering insights that drive real-world impact.

Currently pursuing my undergraduate degree 🎓 at Uttaranchal University, I specialize in transforming raw datasets into meaningful business intelligence. I thrive at the intersection of **data, statistics, and strategy**, where numbers evolve into actionable insights.

From cleaning complex datasets to building interactive dashboards, I enjoy solving business problems through analytical thinking and structured decision-making.

I strongly believe:
