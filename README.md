## 👋 Who Am I?

I’m Hemant — an undergraduate 🎓 at **Uttaranchal University**, driven by curiosity and guided by logic.

I don’t just analyze data —  
I decode patterns, extract signals from noise, and translate numbers into strategic decisions.

Where others see spreadsheets,  
I see business stories waiting to be told.

## 🧭 My Analytical Philosophy

📊 Data without context is just noise  
📈 Insight without action is just theory  
🎯 Analysis should always drive decisions  

I believe in building solutions that are:
- Structured
- Insightful
- Business-Oriented
- Impact-Focused
